<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am an enthusiastic individual with a strong desire to contribute my diverse skill set to the realm of data analytics. 
  Armed with a solid educational background in computer science and A-Levels in IT, I am proficient in Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative software. 
  My hands-on experience includes building a website for my local church, demonstrating my readiness for data analytics tasks. 
  I possess the ability to explain technical concepts, manage projects using Gantt charts, and create augmented reality experiences using Adobe Aero. 
  Beyond my technical skills, my background in tutoring and photography complements my analytical abilities, while my robust teamwork, communication, 
  and organisational skills make me a valuable asset to any data analytics team.</p>

  <p>Outside of my job, I like doing things that bring me joy. I enjoy reading books and playing games. 
    My top authors are Franz Kafka and Fyodor Dostoevskyâ€”they just know how to tell a good story. 
    Playing games is another thing I like; it's fun and keeps things interesting. 
    These hobbies are my way of relaxing and having a good time while keeping things simple.
    In the i plan on pursuing hiking as i enjoy taking scenery in. </p>
